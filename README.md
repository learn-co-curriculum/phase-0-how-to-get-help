# How to Get Help

## Learning Goals

- Know how to get help

## Introduction

We don't believe in learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into
other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed.
Together, we can go further than we could ever go alone. Remember, you are going
to get stuck sometimes! As with any new skill you learn, coding can be difficult
and frustrating. After a certain point, being stuck on a problem becomes
counterproductive - you’re stuck and you need help getting unstuck!

If you get stuck following the instructions or grasping a coding concept, there
are a few things you can do. In this lesson, we'll look at some of the options
available.

## Try Troubleshooting First

Troubleshooting is a critical skill for all programmers and spending time now to
get better at it is time well spent. Improving your ability to troubleshoot will
provide a great return on your investment as you'll be able to get yourself
unstuck and learn how to better approach issues. Whenever possible, try to
troubleshoot your issue independently first before seeking help.

Most issues you'll encounter are error messages in your terminal. A few things
to keep in mind about error messages:

- Not all error messages are equal. Some messages are just warnings. For
  example, if you install a tool and it works, but produces an error when run -
  something is wrong, but it shouldn't be a _blocker_ for you completing work.
- Error messages often provide clues into what may be going wrong. Often, our
  first inclination when faced with an error message is to _flee_. We see some
  incomprehensible output and immediately want to do something else. **Don't do
  this. Read the error!** We'll come back to this with specific examples later
  on in the course.
- Carefully check your spelling and syntax if you receive errors running
  commands or code.
- Getting a different error message after trying something is often _good_. A
  new message can give some indication as to what is working and what isn't.
  
### Use the Resources Available to You

Sometimes, common issues are noted in lesson materials. Other times, errors
occur when an essential step is missed. For these reasons, we recommend
reviewing the resources available to you through Flatiron School:

- Re-read the lesson you're on thoroughly to make sure you’re not missing
  relevant details
- Review previous lessons that may apply to the error or issue you’re
  experiencing, retracing your steps
- Check out [Flatiron's help articles](https://flatironschoolsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us)
  — these articles include advice and answers to frequently asked questions from
  the Flatiron School Team.
  
### Use External Resources
  
If you can't find a solution in the internal resources, the best next step is
often to turn to Google. Some things to note regarding searching:

- How you search yields different results, so it's worth attempting a few
  slightly different searches.
- Copying and pasting an error message is a great thing to search first. Try
  to identify the main part of an error message, often around the beginning or end.
- Refine your search based on the results you're getting. Sometimes, you may
  need to be more specific (i.e. you're using a Mac and need to specify because
  all search results are referring to Windows). Sometimes, being too specific
  will yield too few results. Avoid copying anything that may be specific to
  your system, such as a username.

When looking through solutions on the internet, always be very careful of
commands that alter system files. If you see a command you're not familiar
with, you can always google _that_ command to better understand what it does
before running it.

Even if you aren't able to find an answer on your own, taking the time to try
the options above can help you clarify the question you're asking and eliminate
unsuccessful solutions to the problem. Troubleshooting on your own means that
when you _do_ reach out, you'll be able to ask better, more specific questions.

## Reach Out via Slack

There is a good chance that fellow students have encountered similar challenges
to yours. Use the Slack channels available to you to get help:

- You can post in any public channel (e.g., #general)
- Shortly before you start with a cohort you will be given access to a
  cohort-specific Slack channel
- While you're completing Software Engineering Prep, you can post questions in
  the #js-prework-support channel. There will be other students there who may be
  able to help, and this channel is also staffed by Flatiron School instructors
  from 11am to 7pm eastern time, Monday through Friday.

Equally, if you find someone else asking a question on Slack that you can
provide insight on, please do! One of the best ways to confirm your own
understanding of a concept is to try and help someone else understand it.

## Set Yourself Up for Success

Flatiron's Academic Success Team runs an information session every week to
pass along tips for success and introduce students to the help resources available
to them. These tools will help you as you complete Software Engineering Prep and
throughout your time in the program.
